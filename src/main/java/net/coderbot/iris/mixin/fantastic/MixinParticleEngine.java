/**
 * Extends the ParticleEngine class to allow multiple phases of particle rendering.
 *
 * This is used to enable the rendering of known-opaque particles much earlier than other particles, most notably before
 * translucent content. Normally, particles behind translucent blocks are not visible on Fancy graphics, and a user must
 * enable the much more intensive Fabulous graphics option. This is not ideal because Fabulous graphics is fundamentally
 * incompatible with most shader packs.
 *
 * So what causes this? Essentially, on Fancy graphics, all particles are rendered after translucent terrain. Aside from
 * causing problems with particles being invisible, this also causes particles to write to the translucent depth buffer,
 * even when they are not translucent. This notably causes problems with particles on Sildur's Enhanced Default when
 * underwater.
 *
 * So, what these mixins do is try to render known-opaque particles right before entities are rendered and right after
 * opaque terrain has been rendered. This seems to be an acceptable injection point, and has worked in my testing. It
 * fixes issues with particles when underwater, fixes a vanilla bug, and doesn't have any significant performance hit.
 * A win-win!
 *
 * Unfortunately, there are limitations. Some particles rendering in texture sheets where translucency is supported. So,
 * even if an individual particle from that sheet is not translucent, it will still be treated as translucent, and thus
 * will not be affected by this patch. Without making more invasive and sweeping changes, there isn't a great way to get
 * around this.
 *
 * As the saying goes, "Work smarter, not harder."
